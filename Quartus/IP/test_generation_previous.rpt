Info: Interconnect is inserted between master bridge_0.avalon_master and slave dual_boot_0.avalon because the master has waitrequest signal 1 bit wide, but the slave is 0 bit wide.
Info: Interconnect is inserted between master bridge_0.avalon_master and slave dual_boot_0.avalon because the master has byteenable signal 4 bit wide, but the slave is 0 bit wide.
Info: Interconnect is inserted between master bridge_0.avalon_master and slave dual_boot_0.avalon because the master has address signal 24 bit wide, but the slave is 3 bit wide.
